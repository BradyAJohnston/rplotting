# Intro to Plotting and Aesthetics in R

This is a very basic introduction to using `R` and `R Studio` to plot
biological data that you would otherwise be doing in excel. 

`R` is an incredibly powerful tool, not only for statiscal computing
but also in creating easily readable and aesthetically pleasing plots.

If you find yourself plotting similar data multiple times, creating an
`R` script can save you a lot of time in producing publication quality data.
